#SuperSigs#

A dynamic customisable forum signature generation script for [HLStatsX:Community Edition](http://hlxcommunity.com/).

##What is it?##
SuperSigs allows each forum member to personalise their signature to show just as much (or as little) information about them as they want. It takes data from the HLStats:CE database and makes a cool signature image that updates every hour.

![SuperSigs Example](http://github.com/mfoo/SuperSigs/raw/master/example.png "SuperSigs Example")

It is designed to work with multiple Team Fortress 2 servers on the same host and will soon be extended to support other games that HLStatsX:CE supports.

##Installation##
For installation, troubleshooting and bug reporting, please see the  [Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mfoo/SuperSigs/) and the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/mfoo/SuperSigs/issues).
