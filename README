README

SuperSigs allows users to produce custom forum signatures using data from
HLStatsX:CE (http://www.hlxcommunity.com/).

For an example, see example.png in this folder.

Supersigs is free and available for download and editing. All you need is a
server with HLstats Community Edition (or permission to access it's database)
and the GD image library - so if you have HLStatsX:CE already then you can run
SuperSigs. Configuration is mininal, and the installation simply involves
copying the files across and changing a few lines in the config file.

If anybody makes any improvements then please let me know :)

For installation instructions see INSTALL.

For upcoming changes see TODO.
