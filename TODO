TODO

Things left to do:
* Gather images for games other than TF2
* Add support for games that do not have roles in hlstats_Roles
* Find a default server ID if one is not specified to allow support for people who are using an old version of SuperSigs and haven't updated recently.
* Change the "Nothing" list element to blank.
* Set the default highlighted item as a list item rather than the code of the list item on refresh in the generator.
* Update the signature script box with JavaScript when changed
