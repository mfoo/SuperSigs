=How do I add my own backgrounds?=
The script randomly selects backgrounds for each class from a folder, so all you
have to do is upload an image of the correct size into the folder with the right
filename. The size used by the signatures is 400 x 75 pixels.
1.) Edit your screenshot or image so that it is the correct size.
2.) Look inside the supersigs/images/[YOUR GAME] directory where [YOUR GAME] is
	the name of you game (such as "tf" for Team Fortress 2).
3.) Select the folder for the class name that you want to add the picture for
	(or add one if it isn't there) and take a look at the files in the folder.
	Each file should be named 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg etc.
4.) Find the highest number, add one to it, and save your new image to the
	folder with that number as it's name.

=How do I add my own fonts?=
To add a new font, just upload the TrueType font (.ttf file) to the fonts
directory of your SuperSigs installation. Check the generator and it should now
appear in the list.

=How do I add new information to the script?=
Adding new data and text to the script requires a little knowledge of HTML, PHP
and SQL. If you're not sure what to do, send me a message. If you're confident
enough to change things then you need to change two files.

If you look at functions.php, you have access to the variable $playerID which is
the numeric of the player in the hlstats_Players table. Write an SQL query that
returns the information you want to display, then scroll down through
functions.php until you find the switch statement. Add a new statement on the
bottom of the switch in the same style as the others, such that $text will
contain the thing that you want to write out at the end. Save the file, then
take a look at generate.php. At the top is a function called printLots($name)
which is in charge of creating the drop down menu selections. Add in the line:

	echo "\t\t\t<option value=\"[NAME]\">[TEXT]</option></br>\n";
	
where [NAME] is the text you placed in the switch statement in functions.php and
[TEXT] is the option name you want to display in the drop down menu.
